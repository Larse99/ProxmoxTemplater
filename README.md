# Proxmox Templater

Easily convert your favorite Linux Cloud image (QCOW, .img) into a fully functional Proxmox template, ready for customization with Cloud-Init. This tool enables Cloud-Init options in Proxmox, allowing you to configure essential settings like networking from the very first boot!

## Prerequisites

Before using this tool, ensure you have **Python 3.11** installed. While newer versions may work, this script has been tested specifically with Python 3.11.

## Installation

Installation is straightforward. Since this tool is available as a Python package, you can install it using `pip`. If you prefer a clean setup, you can run it within a virtual environmentâ€”this is my recommended approach.

### Quick Installation

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Larse99/ProxmoxTemplater.git

# Set up a Python virtual environment (optional but recommended)
cd ProxmoxTemplater && python3 -m venv venv && source venv/bin/activate

# Install the package
python3 -m pip install -e .

# Run the tool
ptemplate -c <settings.yaml>
```

## Usage

Using this tool is simple. You'll need:

1.  A `settings.yaml` file (an example is provided in the `Example` directory).
2.  A Linux Cloud image (e.g., Debian, Ubuntu, AlmaLinux).
3.  A Cloud-Init configuration file (also available in the `Example` directory).
    

### How It Works

The script reads the contents of the `settings.yaml` file and executes its instructions. You can create multiple settings files (e.g., `ubuntu24.yaml`, `ubuntu2204.yaml`) for different templates.

After installation, you can organize your files in any way you prefer. A recommended structure looks like this:

```
|-- cloudConfigs
|   |-- ssh.key
|   |-- almalinux9.yaml
|   |-- debian12.yaml
|   `-- ubuntu2404.yaml
|-- Templates
|   |-- alma9-settings.yaml
|   |-- debian12-settings.yaml
|   `-- ubuntu2404-settings.yaml
|-- cloudImages
|   |-- almalinux-9.5-amd64.qcow2
|   |-- debian-12.qcow2
|   |-- jammy-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
|   `-- noble-server-cloudimg-amd64.img
```
